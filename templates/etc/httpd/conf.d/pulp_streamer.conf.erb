    # Each block checks for the existence of a key in the query string and, if
    # present, rewrites the URL to remove the key and its value. It begins by
    # attempting to find the string 'policy=' that is is directly after a '&'
    # or ';', unless it starts the query string. Both '&' and ';' are valid
    # separators in a query string. Next, it matches everything after the
    # 'policy=' until it encounters another '&' or ';', or if the end of the
    # string is reached. Finally, the string is rewritten with the 'policy='
    # plus everything after it to the '&', ';', or end of string removed.
